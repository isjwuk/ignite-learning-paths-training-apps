# APPS50: Taking Your App to the Next Level with Monitoring, Performance and Scaling

## Session Abstract

Making sense of application logs and metrics has been a challenge at Tailwind Traders. Some of the most common questions getting asked within the company are: ‚ÄúHow do we know what we're looking for? Do we look at logs? Metrics? Both?‚Äù Using Azure Monitor and Application Insights helps Tailwind Traders elevate their application logs to something a bit more powerful: telemetry. In session, you‚Äôll learn how the team wired up Application Insights to their public-facing website and fixed a slow-loading home page. Then, we expand this concept of telemetry to determine how Tailwind Traders‚Äô fixes issues present in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster. Finally, we‚Äôll look into capacity planning and scale with powerful yet easy services like Azure Front Door.
